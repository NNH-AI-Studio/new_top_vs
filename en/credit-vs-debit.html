                        <div class="faq-question">Should I use a credit card or debit card for everyday purchases?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            Credit card if you have discipline; debit if you don't. Credit cards offer 1-5% cashback, fraud protection, and purchase warranties - you're losing money using debit for routine spending. However, this assumes you pay full balance monthly. If you carry balances, 20% APR obliterates any 2% rewards. Statistics: 55% of Americans carry credit card balances, paying $1,000+ annually in interest. For these people, debit is smarter despite zero rewards. Disciplined users should use credit for all purchases except where debit required (rent, utilities sometimes). Pay statement in full monthly; treat credit card like debit (only spend what you have). This captures rewards while avoiding debt trap. Exception: recovering from debt/bankruptcy should use debit exclusively until habits improve. Test yourself: if you ever paid interest or missed payment, debit is safer choice currently.

                        <div class="faq-question">Why is fraud protection better with credit cards?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            Credit cards protect bank's money; debit cards risk your money. When fraud occurs on credit card, you dispute charge and don't pay that portion of bill. Your checking account is unaffected. Debit card fraud drains your actual money immediately - rent check bounces, bills auto-pay fail, you're broke until bank investigates (7-14 days). Credit cards have stronger legal protections: Fair Credit Billing Act limits liability to $50 (usually $0 in practice). Debit cards fall under Electronic Fund Transfer Act with $500 liability if not reported within 60 days. Real impact: credit card fraud is inconvenience; debit card fraud is financial crisis. Online shopping, sketchy gas stations, restaurants (server takes card) all pose fraud risk. Use credit for these. Save debit for ATM withdrawals only. Many fraud experts refuse to use debit cards except at bank-owned ATMs.

                        <div class="faq-question">Will using a credit card hurt my credit score?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            Only if misused - proper use builds score dramatically. Credit cards affect score through: 1) Payment history (35% of score) - paying on time boosts score; missing payments destroys it. 2) Credit utilization (30%) - keeping balance under 30% of limit is ideal; maxing out cards tanks score. 3) Length of history (15%) - older cards boost score (never close old accounts). 4) New credit (10%) - applying for multiple cards quickly hurts score. 5) Credit mix (10%) - having cards helps. Optimal strategy: get 2-3 credit cards, use for small purchases, pay full balance monthly, keep utilization under 30%. This builds excellent credit (750+ score) within 2 years. Debit cards don't report to credit bureaus - using exclusively means no credit history, making mortgages/loans impossible. Young adults need credit cards to establish credit; avoiding them delays financial milestones (home purchase, good car loan rates). Responsible credit card use is essential for adult financial life.

                        <div class="faq-question">How do I avoid credit card debt?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            Three rules: 1) Pay full statement balance monthly (not minimum payment). Set up autopay for full balance to avoid forgetting. 2) Only charge what you can afford today. Treat credit card like debit - if money isn't in checking account, don't charge it. 3) Check balance weekly. Out of sight = out of mind leads to overspending. Practical tip: create separate checking account for "credit card fund." Transfer amount immediately when charging. When statement arrives, money is waiting. This prevents spending same dollar twice. Warning signs of trouble: making minimum payments, cash advances, using one card to pay another, hiding spending from partner. These indicate debt spiral starting. Fix: stop using credit cards immediately, pay off aggressively, consider balance transfer to 0% APR card (15-18 month offers exist), or seek credit counseling. Average American with credit card debt owes $6,000 at 20% APR = $1,200 interest annually. Compound interest makes escape difficult. Prevention is infinitely easier than cure.

                        <div class="faq-question">Are credit card rewards actually worth it?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            Yes, if you pay full balance monthly; no, if you carry balances. Math: Spend $30,000 annually on 2% cashback card = $600 rewards. Spend same amount on debit = $0 rewards. Over 10 years = $6,000+ (accounting for sign-up bonuses). Travel rewards can be worth more: 2-5 cents per point for business/first class flights. Chase Sapphire Reserve: $95 annual fee, but 3X points on travel/dining worth $900+ annually for frequent travelers. However, one month of carried balance destroys annual rewards: $6,000 balance at 20% APR = $1,200 interest, obliterating $600 in rewards. Statistics show reward seekers spend 12-18% more trying to "maximize points" - the $3,600 extra spending costs more than $600 rewards earned. Recommendation: use rewards cards for fixed expenses (groceries, gas, bills) you'd spend anyway. Don't increase spending to earn rewards. Best cards: Citi Double Cash (2% everything), Chase Freedom (5% rotating categories), AmEx Blue Cash (6% groceries). Avoid premium cards ($500+ annual fees) unless you travel extensively.

                        <div class="faq-question">Can I use a debit card for everything and skip credit cards entirely?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            Yes, but you'll face three major problems: 1) No credit history = denied for mortgages, car loans, even apartment rentals and job applications check credit. Landlords reject applicants without credit scores. You'll need co-signers for everything. 2) Zero fraud protection buffer = if debit card stolen, your rent money disappears until bank investigates. Credit card fraud doesn't affect your cash. 3) Missing $500-1,000 annually in rewards = over lifetime, this is $20K-40K opportunity cost. Additionally, hotels and rental cars place $200-500 holds on debit cards, freezing your money for days. Credit card holds don't impact your cash flow. International travel without credit cards is nearly impossible (hotels abroad often refuse debit). However, if you have compulsive spending issues, addiction to shopping, or history of bankruptcy, debit-only lifestyle prevents debt spiral. Better solution: secured credit card (requires deposit, impossible to overspend) builds credit without debt risk. Use secured card for small recurring bills (Netflix), pay automatically, build credit while maintaining debit for other purchases. Transition to regular credit card once discipline proven.

                                <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards and credit-building benefits but require discipline to avoid debt. Debit cards provide simplicity and spending control but lack rewards and credit-building opportunities. Choose based on your financial responsibility level and whether you can pay credit card balances in full monthly.</p>

                        <p>Responsible credit card use actually helps build credit. Only irresponsible use like late payments or high balances hurts your score.</p>
